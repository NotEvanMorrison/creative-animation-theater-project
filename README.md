# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description the personal interest or problem that your animation addresses. Then explain the user story(s) you identified, and how they help frame making your animation.

As Guitar Players our goal was to help inspire other people to get into learning how to play the guitar. So we decided to code an iconic song into the theatre class that displays each chord needed to play the song Kiss Me by Sixpence None The Richer. We hope that by displaying each chord it would educate others on the various guitar chords they can learn in order to play this song, and many others. We also understand that our code could be used in a learning aspect. We could appeal to coders attempting to learn about data structures, algorithms, and polymorphism.

### The User Stories We Identified Were: 
As a developer, I want to be able to understand polymorphism better as well as how to use animation inside of the theater class.

As an avid music enjoyer, I really want to learn how to play some of my favorite songs on the guitar.

#### How They Frame The Making Of Our Animation
These User Stories help to frame our animation as we would be able to help these two users in learning about both the musical side as well as the coding side of our animation. The music lover could learn the chords required to play this song and many other songs with these same chords. It will be easier for them as their is a visual guide in place. Then the developer could better learn how to code because of the many descriptons we put out inside of our code. They could easily scan through and analyze how our code works!
